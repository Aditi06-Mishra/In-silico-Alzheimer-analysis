  # MSc Thesis – In Silico Analysis of Acetylcholine Modulation by Coumarin Derivatives in Alzheimer's Disease

This repository contains my MSc Bioinformatics thesis submitted to Banaras Hindu University in 2024. The research explores how coumarin derivatives may help modulate acetylcholine levels, a key factor in Alzheimer’s disease, using in silico approaches.

## 📑 Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by a decline in cholinergic neurotransmission. This study investigates the interaction of various coumarin-based compounds with target proteins involved in acetylcholine modulation using molecular docking, ADMET analysis, and drug-likeness screening.

## 🧪 Tools & Techniques Used
- Molecular Docking (AutoDock / PyRx)
- SwissADME for pharmacokinetic profiling
- Lipinski’s Rule of Five for drug-likeness
- Discovery Studio / PyMOL for visualization
